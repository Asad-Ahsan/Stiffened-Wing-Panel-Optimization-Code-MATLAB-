# ✈️ Stiffened Wing Panel Optimization – MATLAB Code

This repository contains a **parametric MATLAB script** developed to optimize stiffened wing panel structures under axial compressive loading. The tool performs over **1 million iterations** across 3, 4, and 5 Z-stiffener configurations to identify optimal designs based on **minimum weight**, **buckling resistance**, and **area ratio compliance**.

Designed for aerospace engineering students, researchers, and professionals working on **semi-monocoque design**, **aircraft panel optimization**, or **structural analysis**.

## 💡 Features

- ✅ MATLAB-based design automation  
- ✅ Euler buckling, area ratio, and geometry constraint filtering  
- ✅ Carpet plot-ready output data  
- ✅ Lightweight, adaptable, and modular code  
- ✅ Ideal for academic and research applications

## 📂 What’s Included

The downloadable package (available via Gumroad) includes:

- `Final_Analysis_Code.m` – Full optimization and validation script  
- `initial_tradeoff2.m` – Preliminary trade-off analysis for stiffener height vs. weight and Euler length

Both scripts are modular, well-commented, and ready to customize for your own material specs, panel dimensions, and loading conditions.
